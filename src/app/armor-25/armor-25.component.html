<p>Concept to improve armour in Destiny 2, giving players greater freedom in how they look, and how they develop their characters - April 2020</p>

<hr />

<p>Concept: Move all stats, mod slots, and light level of armour to the slot. Making all armour pieces function mostly as ornaments.</p>

<p>Aim: To design an armour system where fashion and armour becomes an end game in itself (special unique armour drops from tough triumphs / locations???) and players can choose whatever armour they want, while having maximum control over the stats of their builds.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>To cover the detaisl I will first give a very (very) brief overview of the current situation related to that detail, then detail the changes that I would make to try to improve the situation.</p>

<h4>Slots</h4>

<p>Every type of armour is equippable to a slot (head, chest, arms, legs, class item) depending on some conditions (only 1 exotic at a time, armour must match the class).</p>

<p>Change: No real change here. The changes come in differences to the armour and slot behaviors.</p>

<h4>Stats</h4>

<p>Currently stats are randomly rolled on all armour 2.0 pieces that you pick up, with some pieces having base stats adding up to less than 50 and some reaching up to 70.
Affinity: Similar to stats, each armour piece comes with a randomly rolled affinity, determining the mods that it can equip (although you may now change this affinity as you wish for some cost)</p>

<p>I would propose a more RPG approach. Starting with affinities, each armour slot would be able to switch at will between the 3 different affinities, this is shown in the first, main screen, image. The outline of the equipped armour piece shows it's affinity, the other selectable affinities are shown beside, similar to the class / super element selection. Each of the affinities would have some number of customisable “build” slots (shown at the bottom of the second image numbered 1 - 5). These slots (at the start) would all only have 3 points in each stat value, leading to a base of 18 points.</p>

<h4>Mods</h4>

<p>Mods are currently equippable based on the affinity of the armour, and how any mod points it has.</p>

<p>Mods would function in the same way but move to the armour slot instead of the armour piece. All seasonal mods would be available to be equipped in the slot.</p>

<h4>Masterworking</h4>

<p>Currently achieved by buying the points on the armour piece and upgrading it to 10 points, gives 2 extra points to every stat along with the final mod points.</p>

<p>A special masterworking objective would become available once you have maxed out the points on an affinity for an armour slot, players would select 1 from a choice of 3 or so. Once complete the bonus would be the same in terms of stats - an extra 2 points on each stat, but the mod points would already have been filled during the previous stages of progression.</p>

<h4>Progression</h4>

<p>Currently there is no armour progression, except for paying upgrade materials to improve masterwork level.</p>

<p>To add to the stats, players would be able to select challenges for each affinity in each armour slot. (e.g. solar helmet slot, arc chest slot etc etc). The challenge they select would (to an extent) affect their reward. Each challenge would give 3 allocatable points, and 2 points that would be allocated automatically based on the challenge completed (melee challenge - strength points, grenade challenge - discipline points, super challenge - intellect points, class challenge - class related stuff, block damage, heal teammates, invis kills, dodge at low health etc). Class challenges would allow the player to choose which of the 3 stats they want to add 2 points to (recovery, mobility, resilience), and then give them 3 allocatable points (or perhaps objectives would be possible that would connect to those 3 stats logically - air kills (or a dodge related objective for hunters) - mobility, take damage (or block damage with a barricade for titans) - resilience, heal yourself after being damaged (or heal others or boost damage with a rift for warlocks) - recovery).</p>

<p>As above, each bounty would give 5 total points, players would (for each affinity - so 3 different progressions per armour slot (total 15 progressions) be able to complete a total of 10 challenges. 18 + (10 * 5) + 12 (masterwork) + 10 (mod) = 90. Each armour slot would have a total possible points value of 90 (except class item that would receive the masterwork points and the mod points only).</p>

<p>1 mod point would also be granted for each challenge complete.</p>

<p>Masterwork objectives would work as stated above and be selectable once an armour piece was otherwise completed.</p>

<p>The points gained would (probably) be consistent across all build slots for an affinity, so you would be able to assign your points differently but some would already be assigned based on the challenges you chose. This would be resettable if you decided you didn’t want those points anymore. You would then be able to go back and start from the first objective again to be able to reset your points.</p>

<p>There would also be the opportunity to introduce unique armour perks that players could choose to unlock. The option would only become available after completing a certain number of objectives for that stat (shown in the 2nd image with the available bounties in the recovery and intellect stats). These would use up an objective, therefore lowering the total stat possibilities for that armour piece, and also probably come at some other cost. For example a grenade perk may negatively impact the strength stat, or something similar. An example perk could be:</p>

<p>Grenadier: Grenade multikills now drop orbs and regenerate grenade energy. (-20 strength points)
Pugilist: Consecutive melee kills drop orbs and regenerate melee energy. (-20 discipline points)
*These may encroach on some exotic effects too much, but this kind of perk that benefits the class abilities, grenades and melees would be good for armour perks.</p>

<h4>Exotics and additional effects</h4>

<p>Exotic effects would still be governed by equipping the exotic armour piece as an ornament.</p>

<p>Gambit prime sets would retain their synergy perks. Another possibility that might come from this armour set up is more sets similar to the Gambit Prime sets. Similar to the way exotic armour pieces would retain ownership of those exotic perks, it would be possible
  to give each armour ownership of a certain type of multiplier that would give a stronger effect when equipped with other pieces sharing that multiplier. Possible multipliers could be related to damage / damage resistance against certain enemies / in certain destinations, or perhaps enhancing class effects (better dodge, bigger rift, bigger barricade).
  This may hinder the overall fashion and prestige armour experience so it may be better to find another way to apply this kind of multiplier (which I think would give a lot of new possibilities) so that players first consideration when choosing armour is how they want to look.</p>

<h4>Other armour and light level</h4>

<p>All other armour would function like ornaments. They would have a minimum light level equal to the slot level, although powerfuls and pinnacles may drop higher and allow you to raise your light level.</p>

<h4>Menus and display</h4>

<p>As shown in the images above there would mostly only need to be small adaptations made to the current armor screens to adopt these changes. The biggest changes would be to the armour menu. As this approach has a greater focus on RPG elements, and on choosing how your character progresses, the stats are more prominent on the screen, and there is more to display. However the ornament menu would remain entirely focussed on the look of the armour, effectively dividing the task given to each UI screen, one for optimizing your build, and one for looking exactly how you want to look.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Overall the aim is to make armour less of a grind (and less disappointing, e.g. pit of heresy armour drops…..) by moving most of the stats over to a system where points are attainable through direct action, not through RNG, and more than that the path to improving the armour is clearly stated and known to all players. armour drops would then be more a case of fashion and prestige. You could wear whatever armour you want and your stats would be the same. Wear some unique armour drops from some tough activity to show it off and not have to worry about stat drops. Hopefully those are all the benefits that I consider them to be.</p>

<p>On the other hand removing the armour grind is a double edged sword, once a player has the piece of armour they want and they have got all the stats for it that they can get, there is no further reason for them to hunt for armour in that slot anymore. Also it would be another armour reset, and even if the system ended up being better, a reset is always painful.</p>

<p>One thing that I am still unsure of how to handle would be re-rolling stats. Giving total freedom to re-roll stats defeats the purpose of targetted bounties, however asking players to totally reset their progress and restart all their objectives again to make changes seems overly time consuming and boring. I would hope that providing the build slots would bypass this situation by allowing players to retain the stat builds they have so far (up to a certain number of builds, obviously infinite slots of stat builds would not be possible) and work on others that they want to try out in parallel, while only resetting those that they feel are useless or that they have made mistakes with point allocations in. While I am not 100% satisfied with this solution I feel it satisfies the aim pretty well.</p>

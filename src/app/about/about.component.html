<p>My name is Max Platt (hence the MP in MPG) and I am an aspiring game designer.</p>

<p>Everything I add to this site is added with the aims of practicing and improving my abilities in recognizing, analysing, developing and designing
  interesting and fun games and game mechanics, as well as to show off some of the work that I have <a routerLink="/games">completed</a> and what
  I <a routerLink="/postmortems">learned</a> from each experience.</p>
